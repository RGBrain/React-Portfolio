## Installation

My portfolio is live at INSERT WEB ADDRESS

## Usage

Simply visit INSERT WEB ADDRESS and you can find-out a bit about me, and my projects.  There are also links to my GitHub project repositories on the Projects page.

## Contribution

I am generally very open to contributions, and I generally use the MIT license.  That said, as this website is a showcase of my own work, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to have collaborators.

## Testing

Please let me know if you find any problem with my site: richard.brain@hotmail.co.uk

## Questions

If you have any questions, please contact me directly: richard.brain@hotmail.co.uk
